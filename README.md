# Data_Visualization
From August 2018 to November 2018, I volunteered as a Data Analyst to work remotely to analyze Haiti country for Ayiti Now Corp (https://www.haiti-now.org), a nonprofit organization aiming to empower marginalized children in poverty in Haiti. 

As part of the Data team, I collaborated with other volunteers to extract valuable information and visualize it to help expedite decision making in allocating resources to the ones who needed most. Specifically, I was involved in cleaning raw dataset based on over 10,000 surveys with R-Studio, and computing critical statistics for subsequent data visualization. Meanwhile, I created a couple of dashboards using Tableau, including bar chart, donut chart, bubble chart, filled map, highlight table, and so on.

These dashboards have been uploaded in this repository. In addition, I have summarized and presented them in my Tableau Public. Please take a look at it through the following link if you are interested.
